# IJDAR_Articles_Classification
Classifying academic papers from International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR) and comparing the performance of several machine learning algorithms using precision and recall values.  

Total no. of documents in the set : 67  
Documents used for training set : 55  
Documents used for testing set : 12  

There were 6 categories namely (derived from keywords) :  
Machine learning (1)  
Pattern recognition (2)  
Character recognition (3)  
Image retrieval (4)  
Information retrieval (5)  
Support Vector Machine (6)  

Classification was done using different machine learning algorithms like Maxent, SVM, Glmnet, SLDA, Tree, Bagging, Boosting and Random Forest.  
The prediction done by the algorithms was comapred to the actual categories.  

The data thus obtained was used to calculate Precision, Recall and F-score for all the machine learning algorithms.  

The values thus obtained were used to compare the performance of the algorithms.
